## This is Terminus Est version 0.9.16alpha

### Setting Up foma

Since foma is not Git-hosted, I can't set it up as a submodule for
this repo. Run the script run.me.first.sh from the Terminus Est directory
and it will try to set up, svn checkout, and compile foma.

You may have to install Subversion and/or flex 2.5.35 in order for all this
to work.

### Someday this will turn into real documentation...

In the meantime, check the foma wiki for more information on foma:
